## Markdown

There are some custom blocks for Markdown(will be automatically converted to styled blocks).

### Set meta data

You have to set post meta data in frontmatter(At the top of each markdown file).

```
title: Example title
date: "2019-01-28T22:40:32.169Z"
description: "This text will be used as meta/og description"
category: "design" //set just 1category
emoji: "üòÅ"  //converted to Twemoji and used as HeroImage
```

```

#### Alert block
